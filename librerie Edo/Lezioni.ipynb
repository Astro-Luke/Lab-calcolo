    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.\n",

    "  * **interpreted**: no program compilation action is needed by the user\n",
    "  * **object-oriented**: organised around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic\n",

    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    " * [NumPy](https://numpy.org) is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.\n",
    " * It provides a **multidimensional array object (`numpy.ndarray`)**, \n",
    "    various derived objects such as masked arrays and matrices,\n",
    "    and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays.\n",
    " * To start using NumPy, simply import the library, usually with the abbreviation `np`:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating NumPy arrays\n",
    "\n",
    " * A `numpy.ndarray` is a **mutable** type.\n",
    " * The **creation** of a `numpy.ndarray` can be done in several different ways.\n",
    "   * From a list:\n",
    "     ```py\n",
    "     a_list = [1, 2, 3,4]\n",
    "     an_array = np.array (a_list)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     * **N.B.**: NumPy array types, while being named `ndarray`, are called with `numpy.array()`\n",
    "   * Generating a collection of `N` zeroes:\n",
    "     ```py\n",
    "     an_array = np.zeros (N)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   * Generating a collection of `N` empty elements \n",
    "     (faster than the previous two, but no certainty on the array content is given):\n",
    "     ```py\n",
    "     an_array = np.empty (N)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   * Generating a range of integer elements\n",
    "     ```py\n",
    "     first = 1\n",
    "     last = 11\n",
    "     step = 2\n",
    "     an_array = np.arange (first, last, step)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   * Generating values that are spaced linearly in a specified interval\n",
    "     ```py\n",
    "     number = 5\n",
    "     an_array = np.linspace (first, last, number)\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{note}\n",
    "   One main difference between the `ndarray` and Python `list` is that `ndarray` has **fixed size after declaration**\n",
    "   It does not mean that the addition of elements is forbidden, \n",
    "   but it does technically require the creation of a new array and the destruction of the starting one.\n",
    "   Therefore, given the memory management operations involved when adding a new element to a `ndarray`, \n",
    "   it is best to create the `ndarray` just before using it and fill a Python `list` if loops are involved \n",
    "   (see the example {ref}`examples:numpy:ndarray`).\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array operations\n",
    "\n",
    " * Operations between arrays may be **written in compact form**, \n",
    "   making them clearer in writing and\n",
    "   achieving a much faster execution,\n",
    "   thanks to the use of optimised internal routines\n",
    " * the element-wise multiplication **performed with lists** requires a loop:   \n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   list_a = list (range (10000))\n",
    "   list_b = list (range (10000))\n",
    "   list_prod = [list_a[i] * list_b[i] for i in range (len (list_a))]\n",

    "   array_b = np.array (list_b)\n",
    "   array_prod = array_a * array_b\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "<!-- example {ref}`examples:numpy:ndarray_operations` -->\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cumulative operations on arrays\n",
    "\n",
    " * The NumPy library contains functions that perform operations with the whole array:\n",
    " * The function `sum` adds all the values present in the array\n",
    " * The function `cumsum` calculates for each element the sum of all the elements preceeding it\n",
    " * The function `prod` multiplies all the values present in the array\n",
    " * The function `cumprod` calculates for each element the product of all the elements preceeding it\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating multi-dimensional arrays\n",
    "\n",
    " * A `ndarray` may have **more than one dimension** (usually called *axes*):\n",

    "   >>> multiD_array\n",
    "   array([[1, 2, 3],\n",
    "          [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "   >>> multiD_array.shape\n",
    "   (2, 3)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   * the `shape` of an array shows its **internal structure**, \n",
    "     in this case composed of two rows and three columns\n",
    " * The functions `zeros` and `ones` may be used also \n",
    "   to **create multi-dimensional objects**:\n",
    "   ```py\n",
    "   an_array = np.ones ((3,2))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "    * this instruction will create an array with three rows and two columns\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```{note}\n",
    "   Accessing the array elements with `A[1,2]` is faster than `A[1][2]` \n",
    "   since the latter involves the creation in memory of another array.\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### NumPy universal functions\n",
    "\n",
    " * Universal functions implement in a compact form operations on arrays,\n",
    "   making it such that a **function may be called on an entire array**\n",
    "   and act on its elements\n",
    " * Several **unviversal functions exist** (the full list may be found [here](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/ufuncs.html#available-ufuncs),\n",
    "   including \n",
    "   mathematical operations (e.g. `add`, `subtract`)\n",
    "   and fundamental functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## MatPlotLib\n",
    "\n",
    "  * A widely used **library for visualisation** is [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/),\n",
    "    which may be used to draw functions and histograms.\n",
    "  * The first Python object that will be used in the course as a starting point\n",
    "    is the [```matplotlib.pyplot```](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/pyplot_summary.html) one, \n",
    "    which usually gets imported at the script beginning:\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "  * When using the library,\n",
    "    **two types of objects** will usually by created and handled:\n",
    "    * [```matplotlib.axes```](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html): \n",
    "      used for the plotting of the actual content of the figure\n",
    "    * [```matplotlib.figure```](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html): \n",
    "      used for axes creation and figure appearence\n",
    "  * The creation of an empty image starts from the ```matplotlib.pyplot``` object:\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    fig, ax = plt.subplots (nrows = 1, ncols = 1)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    where ```fig``` and ```ax``` are the usual names given \n",
    "    to the ```matplotlib.figure``` and ```matplotlib.axes```\n",
    "    objects that have been created.\n",
    "    * The arguments of the ```subplots``` method indicate the **number of sub-plots**\n",
    "      that will be present in the image,\n",
    "      listed in rows and columns.\n",
    "    * In case more than one sub-plot is present, \n",
    "      **the variable ```ax``` will be a container**: \n",
    "      a single list if ```nrows = 1``` or ```ncols = 1```, \n",
    "      a list of lists otherwise.\n",
    "  * Once an image is created,\n",
    "    it needs to be **visualised** on the screen with the call to the ```show``` function,\n",
    "    **or saved** on disk with the call to the ```savefig``` function \n",
    "    of the object ```matplotlib.pyplot```:\n",
    "    ```py\n",
    "    plt.savefig ('example_01.png')\n",
    "    plt.show ()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawing functions\n",
